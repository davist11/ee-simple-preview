h1. Simple Preview

Instead of having to deal with "Live Look", this EE 2.0 accessory simply adds a Preview link to the page you see after submitting an entry. This way, you can utilize your already build single entry view for previews without much fuss.

h2. Installation

# Copy the simple_preview folder into your third_party directory.
# Go to Add-Ons > Accessories and install Simple Preview.
# Enter the url to your single entry template in the *Channel URL* field in Channel Preferences.
# Allow closed statuses on your single entry template.

h3. Example

I have a blog channel that lives at /blog. The individual blog post URLs are /blog/{url_title}. In the preferences for the blog channel, I enter /blog/ into the Channel URL field. The URL for the preview link will be /blog/{url_title}/preview.

Then, I need to make sure to allow closed status entries for the individual view, so my blog template looks like this:

<pre>{if segment_2}
	{!--This is the individual blog entry--}
	
	{exp:channel:entries
		channel="blog"
		limit="1"
		status="open{if segment_3 == "preview"}|closed{/if}"
	}
	
	{/exp:channel:entries}
	
{if:else}
	{!--This is the blog listing page--}
{/if}</pre>
